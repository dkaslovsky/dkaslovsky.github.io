Mostly out-of-date academic website

I built this website in 2010 while in grad school to serve as a homepage for my academic career, from which I've since moved on.
This was the first time I had ever touched HTML and wrote it all by hand (yikes)!
__Please pass no judgement!__

The website remains up but is almost entirely unmaintained.
One day I might retire it in favor of something more current.
